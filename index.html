        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <span>Jade Quest is a platform game set during ninja era. You will control a little ninja whose temple has been robed. The goal of the game is to retrieve a statue, stolen by ninja enemies. You will first have to collect scrolls of power which will give you special abilities. One choice is possible, which give three possible ways of playing. You will have to collect resources along the way to craft weapons such as shurikens and a katana.</span>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <img src="goku.png"/><span>The hero of the game will certainly remind you of Goku from Dragon Ball franchise. I found that his shape fitted the movement required for the game.<br/>Part of this is true, but I also used him because my animations and artistic skills don't live up to the animations required for the game, and with research I manage to find some Goku sprites to make my own.</span>
            <img src="braid.jpg"/><span>For the mechanics of the game most of my inspiration comes from every platform game I ever played, such as Limbo, Rayman and more recently Braid. I was very impressed by the level design of this game and some modules/puzzles present in the game come from this one.</span><img src="limbo.jpeg"/>
